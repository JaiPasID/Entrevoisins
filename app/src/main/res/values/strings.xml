    <string name="blabla">This is a strong build for the pig that doesn’t rely on her reverse pig traps to get kills, but it still helps to get a survivor to stay off of generators. I love the Saw movies that the Pig came from and she is one killer I’d love to get when I’m able to because she’s a strong stealth killer able to crouch and ambush. The Pig is a hard killer to play but is worth getting to know and use because she is one of few killers with more than one part to her power. What Educational Piggy Excels In You’ll be able to learn the Pig and get used to her powers, crouch and ambush, and the reverse bear trap that makes a survivor forced to get a key and not work on generators.</string>
